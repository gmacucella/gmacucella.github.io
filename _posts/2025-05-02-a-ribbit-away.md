This was my first complex group project focused on game development, created as part of the Game Development university exam. It was a great opportunity to learn how to use Unity and how to work effectively as a small team.

A Ribbit Away is a 2D platformer with pixel art graphics, designed with special care toward character design, environmental storytelling, and music. The game follows the story of Fherb, the main character, offering dynamic and active gameplay. As players progress through the levels, they naturally discover and learn the game mechanics.

Each character is defined by a unique trait whether it's their way of speaking or their design. Players can interact with various elements in the environment, as well as with other characters. A shop system allows items to be purchased and used strategically, using the game's in-game currency.

We had the opportunity to present a playable demo at local game events, where we practiced pitching and received feedback from hundreds of people. This was incredibly valuable in helping us improve the gameplay experience and better understand how to transform creative concepts into fun mechanics.

**Events we showcased at:**
- *GameFest*, Cellamare (Bari), Italy: 2023 & 2024 editions
- *LevanteFor*, Bari, Italy: 2024 edition

> 🚀 **Download the demo now on Itch.io!**
> Please note: dialogues are currently available only in Italian, but an English translation is in the works!
