The Quercus Game is an educational role-playing game developed as part of my bachelor‚Äôs thesis in Computer Science, in collaboration with the municipality of Gravina in Puglia. The game was designed to raise awareness about the protection of Bosco Difesa Grande, one of the most significant natural areas in the region, by offering an engaging experience that blends entertainment with environmental education.

Targeted primarily at players aged 9 to 18, the game is currently available as a PC demo and features a mix of RPG, adventure, life simulation, and minigames. Its core goal is to foster environmental consciousness and cultural awareness through meaningful interactions and playful storytelling.

## My Role & Thesis Focus
As part of my thesis, I developed one of the project‚Äôs core minigames, titled "Convinci il Bracconiere" which translates to "Convince the Poacher". This segment draws inspiration from the turn-based mechanics of classic games like Pok√©mon, the environmental themes of Stardew Valley, and especially the ACT system from Undertale, specifically its ACT mechanic, which allows players to resolve encounters non-violently.

In a similar spirit, this minigame tasks players, as forest rangers, with persuading a poacher to abandon illegal hunting. The encounter plays out like an ironic battle, where instead of fighting, players must select the right arguments while managing a ‚Äúpersuasion meter.‚Äù To succeed, players also complete dynamic tasks such as locating and dismantling traps, further immersing them in the role of a protector of nature. The overall experience reinforces the game's core message: promoting environmental awareness through empathy, dialogue, and meaningful action.

Another major component of the thesis is the creation of the ‚ÄúForest Protection Score‚Äù interface, a dedicated screen that shows the player‚Äôs overall contribution to conservation efforts. This score reflects their performance across various minigames and completed objectives, offering both feedback and motivation.

## üí° What I Worked On & Learned
- **Godot Engine & GDScript**: Gained hands-on experience with Godot‚Äôs node-based architecture and scripting through GDScript
- **Finite State Machines**: how to implement them and how to use them to manage a **turn based combat system**
- **HUD Development in Godot**: Designed and integrated UI elements for health, interactions, and nested minigames (inspired by WarioWare-style microgames, such as dismantling traps)
- **Achievements System**: Designed and integrated a basic reward system tied to player actions
- **Pixel Art Workflow**: Learned to adapt and refine assets using **LibreSprite** and similar tools, improving my ability to work with custom pixel art in a game environment
