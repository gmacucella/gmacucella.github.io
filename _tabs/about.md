Hi! I'm G. M. "Mars" Acucella, a recent graduate in Computer Science with a passion for programming and game development. I'm always on the lookout for new opportunities to learn, experiment, and grow. Whether it's exploring new technologies or diving into unfamiliar fields, I enjoy pushing my boundaries and developing my skills.

I thrive in collaborative environments and believe that working together with others who share similar passions leads to the best results. I find that I work well with all kinds of people and always strive to create an atmosphere where everyone can contribute, respect one another, and work towards common goals. In turn, I make it a point to foster such an environment in my own work and interactions.

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to chat about game development, share ideas, or just connect!
